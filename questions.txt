Hi Dylan, to help you better understand the code, I need you to answer the questions listed here:

1. How is a "score" registered and when is a "miss" registered in this game? HINT: Look into the game loop area.

2. What are the different classes I have in this project and what do they do?

3. How can I change the player sprites? Can you explain the player sprites needed for this game to run smoothly?

4. What is the function in load_img.py used for? Why did I keep that function in a seperate file?

5. What does the score() function do under the ArrowBW class?

5.1 How does the score() function work? In other words, how does it change colours from grey to green to grey again? How does the game know when it's time to change?

5.2 Try increasing the duration in which the green arrow is shown.

6. What is the GameMaster class used for?

6.1 Explain the method choose_next_arrow() under GameMaster class to me.

6.2 How can I speed up the frequency of the arrows? Try slowing/speeding it up

7. List out the different sprite groups in this project

7.1 Why did I create sprite groups for each arrow type like right_arrow_sprites, left_arrow_sprite, etc instead of storing all of them under arrow_sprites? 

8. I wish to see your commitment to this project, as such, I would like you to study the code in your own time and try to implement an "enemy" sprite at the side. Discuss with me how this enemy sprite should look and what functions he should have.
